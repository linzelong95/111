Erica: Would you like to play a game?

Andrew: Ok, what kind of game?

Erica: Let's play cards. Do you know how to play blackjack?

Andrew: Yes, that's a easy game. I don't want to play that right now.

Erica: Ok. Do you know how to play poker?

Andrew: I think so, but you're going to have to explain the rules to me again.

Erica: Ok. Look at this piece of paper. It has all the rules on it.

Andrew: Ok, yes. I remember now. I think the last time we played this game, you won and I lost.

Erica: Yes, that was fun.

Andrew: Ok, let's paly, but this time I don't want to bet money.

Erica: Ok, we won't bet. We'll just play for fun.

安德鲁:好，哪种游戏?

爱丽卡:我们玩牌吧。你知道怎么玩二十一点吗?

安德鲁:是的，这是一个简单的游戏。我现在不想玩这个。

爱丽卡:好。你会打扑克吗?

安德鲁:我想是的，但是你得再给我解释一遍规则。

爱丽卡:好。看这张纸。上面有所有的规则。

安德鲁:好吧,是的。我现在记起来了。我想上次我们玩这个游戏，你赢了，我输了。
