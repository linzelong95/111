Linda: Are you hungry?

Robert: NO, why?

Linda: We've been driving for a long time. I think we'd better find some place to eat soon.

Robert: No, I'm ok. We're late so we'd better not stop.

Linda: We've passed that same store three times already. I think we're lost. We should ask someone for directions.

Robert: We're not lost.

Linda: I've never gone this way before. Do you know where you're going?

Robert: Yes, this road goes through town. It's faster than the highway.

Linda: Ok. Would you mind driving a little slower please?

Robert: Sure, no problem.

Linda: Did you see that sign back here? I think this is a one way street.

Robert: No, I didn't see it. I'm going to have to turn around.

Linda: You can't turn around here. I think you should let me drive.

Robert: I think you're right. I'm getting tired.

琳达:你饿吗?

罗伯特:不,为什么（这么问）?

琳达:我们开了很长时间了。我想我们最好快点找个地方吃饭。

罗伯特:不，我很好。我们要迟到了，所以最好不要停下来。

琳达:我们已经经过那家商店三次了。我想我们迷路了。我们应该向人问路。

罗伯特:我们没有迷路。

琳达:我以前从没有走过这条路。你知道你要去哪里吗?

罗伯特:是的，这条路穿过城镇。它比高速公路还快。

琳达:好的。请你开慢一点好吗?

罗伯特:当然，没问题。

琳达:你看到后面那个标志了吗?我认为这是一条单行道。

罗伯特:不，我没看到。我得掉头了。

琳达:你不能在这里掉头。我觉得你应该让我来开车。

罗伯特:我想你是对的。我累了。
