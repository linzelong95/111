Adam: No problem. I'll help you look for it.

Barbara: Thanks.

Adam: What color is it?

Barbara: It's black.

Adam: Did you look in the kitchen?

Barbara: Yes. I already looked there.

Adam: I'll look in the living room.

Barbara: Did you find it?

Adam: No. It's not in there. When was the last time you saw it?

Barbara: I had it when I went to the library this morning.

Adam: Do you think you might have left it there?

Barbara: Maybe. I'll call the library and ask them if anyone found it.

Adam: Wait! Is this it?

Barbara: Yes. That's it. That's my purse. Thanks for helping me find it.
