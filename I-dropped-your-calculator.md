Thomas: Hi Tracy. What's going on?

Tracy: Hi Thomas, I'm waiting in line to buy a DVD player .

Thomas: The line is too long. Why don't you come back tomorrow?

Tracy: I think you're right. They're going to close soon.

Thomas: Let's go get some coffee.

Tracy: Ok. Wait a minute. I have to get something out of my purse. Will you hold this for me?

Thomas: Sure, Oops.

Tracy: What happened?

Thomas: I dropped your calculator. Is it broken?

Tracy: I'm not sure. Let me have a look. No, I don't think it's broken. The button came off though. I can fix it.

Thomas: Sorry about that.

Tracy: Don't worry about it. I do that all the time. If it is broken, I have another one in my car.

托马斯:你好,特蕾西。这是怎么呢

崔西:你好，托马斯，我在排队买DVD播放器。

托马斯:队伍太长了。你何不明天再来?

特蕾西:我想你是对的。他们很快就要关门了。

托马斯:我们去喝点咖啡吧。

特蕾西:好的。等一下，我得从包里拿点东西。帮我拿一下好吗?

托马斯:当然,哎哟。

特蕾西:发生了什么事?

托马斯:我把你的计算器掉了。是坏了吗?

特蕾西:我不确定。让我看看。不，我想它没有坏。但是这个按钮掉了。我能修好它。

托马斯:很抱歉。

崔西:别担心。我也总是这样。如果它坏了，我车里还有一个。
