## Bill got fired

```
John: Hello?

Ann: Hi, John, sorry for calling so late. I hope I didn't wake you up.

John: Actually, I was just finishing some work. I haven't gone to bed yet.

Ann: Did you hear Bill got fired yesterday?

John: No, I didn't hear that. Are you sure?

Ann: Yeah, Sarah told me this afternoon. She was pretty upset about it.

John: That's too bad. Bill's a nice guy.

Ann: Yeah, I know.

John: Why did they fire him?

Ann: She didn't say.

John: I see. Well, if you talk to Sarah again, tell her there's a job opening at my company. Bill can have a interview this week if he wants.

Ann: Oh, thank you so much. I'll call her and tell her.

## 比尔被解雇了

```
约翰:你好?

安妮:嗨，约翰，很抱歉这么晚打电话来。希望没吵醒你。

约翰:事实上，我刚做完一些工作。我还没睡觉呢。

安妮:你听说比尔昨天被解雇了吗?

约翰:没有，我没听说。你确定吗?

安妮:是的，莎拉今天下午告诉我的。她为此很难过。

约翰:那太糟糕了。比尔是个不错的人。

安妮:是的，我知道。

约翰:他们为什么要解雇他?

安妮:她没说。

约翰:我明白了。好吧，如果你再和莎拉说话，告诉她我们公司有个职位空缺。如果比尔愿意，他可以在这个星期来面试。

安妮:哦，太谢谢你了。我会打电话告诉她的。
