Richard: Hey, How did you get here?

Jennifer: I rode my bike.

Richard: Are you serious? Why did you do that? I could have picked you up.

Jennifer: That's ok. I didn't want to bother you. I know you don't like to wake up early.

Richard: That's so nice of you. Aren't you cold?

Jennifer: No, not really. I wore a coat.

Richard: What's in the bag?

Jennifer: It's a special type of apple.

Richard: Oh, can I try one? It's very sweet.

Jennifer: I put sugar on it. These apples are really good. They were only 30 cents each.

Richard: Aren't those more expensive than the ones at the supermarket?

Jennifer: Yeah, they're more expensive, but they taste better.

Richard: Did you buy any other fruit?

Jennifer: Well, besides the apples, I bought oranges and bananas.

珍妮佛:这是一种特殊的苹果。

理查德:哦，我能试试吗?它很甜。
