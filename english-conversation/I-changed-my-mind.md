```
Ellen: Kevin, what would you like to do?

Kevin: I don't know. Maybe watch TV.

Ellen: That's a good idea. We're going shopping later so I think you should rest for a while.

Kevin: I don't think I want to go anymore.

Ellen: What do you mean? I thought you said we were going shopping.

Kevin: I know, but I changed my mind. I'm so tired.

Ellen: Well, I still have a lot of stuff to buy. When do you think we'll go?

Kevin: Maybe tonight.

Ellen: Ok. Would you mind if I use your phone?

Kevin: Sorry. I don't have signal.

Ellen: Are you kidding? I usually have really good reception here.

Kevin: My phone is very old and it doesn't work very well.

Ellen: What if I take it outside?

Kevin: Yes, that's fine. It works well outside.

埃伦:凯文，你想做什么?

凯文:我不知道。也许看电视。

埃伦:好主意。我们一会儿要去购物，所以我想你应该休息一会儿。

凯文:我想我再也不想去了。

埃伦:你是什么意思?我以为你说我们要去购物。

凯文:我知道，但是我改变主意了。我太累了。

埃伦:嗯，我还有很多东西要买。你觉得我们什么时候去?

凯文:也许今晚。

埃伦:好。你介意我用你的电话吗?

凯文:对不起。我没有信号。

你在开玩笑吗?我这里的信号通常都很好。

凯文:我的手机很旧，不太好用。

埃伦:如果我在外面打呢?

凯文:可以，很好。它在室外很好用。
