Taxi driver: Hello Miss, Do you need a taxi?

Mary: Yes.

Taxi driver: Do you have any luggage?

Mary: Just these two suitcases.

Taxi driver: Ok, I'll put them in the back for you. Where are you going?

Mary: The Comfort Inn.

Taxi driver: I think there are two in Boston. Which one are you going to?

Mary: The one downtown.

Taxi driver: Is this your first time in Boston?

Mary: No, I've been here many times. I come here for work all the time. Do you know how long it'll take?

Taxi driver: It shouldn't take long. Probably about 15 minutes.

Mary: Wow, it looks like the traffic is really bad.

Taxi driver: Yeah, there might be an accident up ahead.

Mary: Ok, then stop at the next intersection. I'm gonna get out there and take the subway.
