## Worried about dad

```
Kim: Hi Peter, can I talk to you for a moment. I just heard the cookie factory downtown is going out of business.

Peter: Where did you hear that?

Kim: Sara told me.

Peter: I'm not sure that's true. I haven't heard anything about it.

Kim: She said that they have already started to lay people off.

Peter: Doesn't your father work there?

Kim: Yes. I'm really worried he might get laid off. He just started to work there about three months ago. What do you think I should do?

Peter: I'd talk to your father.

Kim: Yeah, but if there was something wrong I don't think he'd tell me. He doesn't like to upset me, but I really would like to know what's going on.

Peter: So what are you gonna to do?

Kim: Aren't you good friends with the president of that company?

Peter: Yes, we use to work together at a different company about five years ago.

Kim: Maybe you could call him and see what's going on.

Peter: Well, I don't know. I guess I could. It's pretty late now, but I'll call him in the morning.

Kim: Ok, thanks so much.

## 担心父亲

```
金:嗨，彼得，我能和你谈谈吗?我刚听说市中心的饼干厂要倒闭了。

彼得:你从哪儿听说的?

金:莎拉告诉我了。

彼得:我不确定这是不是真的。我还没有听说过这件事。

金:她说他们已经开始裁员了。

彼得:你爸爸不是在那里工作吗?

金:是的。我真担心他会被解雇。他大约三个月前才开始在那里工作。你觉得我该怎么做?

彼得:我会和你父亲谈谈。

金:是的，但如果出了什么问题，我想他不会告诉我的。他不想让我难过，但我真的很想知道发生了什么事。

彼得:那你打算怎么办?

金:你和那家公司的总裁不是好朋友吗?

彼得:是的，大约五年前我们在另一家公司一起工作过。

金:也许你可以给他打个电话，看看发生了什么事。

彼得:嗯，我不知道。我想我可以。现在已经很晚了，但我明早会打电话给他。

金:好的，非常感谢。
