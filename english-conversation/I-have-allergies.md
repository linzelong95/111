Beth: Patrick, why didn't you call me last night? I was worried about you.

Patrick: Sorry, I was sick. I went to bed early.

Beth: What's wrong?

Patrick: I had a cough and my eyes were really dry.

Beth: Are you better now?

Patrick: Yes, I'm feeling a lot better. Much better than yesterday.

Beth: Do you have allergies?

Patrick: Yes. Last time I went to the doctor, he did some tests and told me I have allergies. It gets worse in the spring.

Beth: What time did you wake up this morning?

Patrick: Around 9:30AM.

Beth: Are you going to work today?

Patrick: No. I think I'll just stay home and watch TV. I can work from home today.

Beth: Good. Get some rest and I'll bring over some food later.

Patrick: Thanks.

Patrick: 对不起，我生病了，早早就睡了。

Beth: 怎么啦？

Patrick: 我咳嗽了，眼睛很干涩。

Beth: 你现在好点了吗？

Patrick: 是的，我感觉好多了。比昨天好多了。

Beth: 你有过敏反应吗？

Patrick: 大约九点半。

Beth: 今天你还打算工作吗？

Patrick: 不了。我想我还是呆在家里看电视。今天我可以在家工作。
