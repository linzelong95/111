## Snowing outside

```
Donna: Hey, what have you been doing today?

Robert: Nothing, just watching TV. I'm really bored. I don't have anything to do.

Donna: I don't have anything to do either. I didn't do anything today except clean my house.

Robert: I know. I was planning to go to the mall today with one of my friends, but it snowed so much we couldn't go anywhere.

Donna: I hope it snows all night because I don't want to go to school tomorrow.

Robert: Do you know anyone who has a camera? I want to take a picture of all this snow.

Donna: No, I don't know anyone who has a camera.

Robert: Have you seen Sara today? I think she might have one.

Donna: No, she hasn't been around all day. She said she had Something important to do today.

Robert: Oh, where did she go?

Donna: Nobody knows. I called her roommate and she doesn't know either.

## 外面在下雪

```
唐娜:嘿，你今天做什么了?

罗伯特:没什么，只是看电视。我真的很无聊。我没事可做。

唐娜:我也没什么事可做。我今天除了打扫房间什么也没做。

罗伯特:我知道。我本来打算今天和一个朋友去购物中心，但是雪下得太大了，我们哪儿也去不了。

唐娜:我希望雪下一整晚，因为我明天不想去上学。

罗伯特:你知道谁有照相机吗?我想给这些雪照张相。

唐娜:不，我不知道谁有照相机。

罗伯特:你今天看到萨拉了吗?我想她可能有。

唐娜:没有，她一整天都不在。她说她今天有重要的事要做。

罗伯特:哦，她去哪儿了?

唐娜:没人知道。我打电话给她室友，她也不知道。
