Lisa: Hello?

James: Hi. Are you still up?

Lisa: Yes.

James: You sound tired. Is everything Ok?

James: Do you have time to get some coffee with me later? I have something I want to talk to you about.

Lisa: No, sorry. Not today. I have to get up early tomorrow.

James: Oh. What are you going to do tomorrow?

Lisa: My mother-in-law is coming over so I have to get up early and clean the house.
