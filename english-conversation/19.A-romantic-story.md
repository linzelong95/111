## A romantic story

```
Paul: Betty, are you and John still dating?

Betty: Yeah, things are going really good.

Paul: Where did you meet him?

Betty: I met him at the library a couple weeks a ago. We were sitting at the same table and he asked to borrow my pen.

Paul: Wow, that's a nice story.

Betty: I was telling Jim about it the other day. He thought it was pretty romantic.

Paul: Do you two have plans for tonight?

Betty: Yes, I think we're going to rent a movie. Have you seen anything good lately?

Paul: I saw Spider-Man the other day.

Betty: I've heard that's a really funny movie.

Paul: Are you kidding? That movie's not funny. It's sad. I was crying at the end.

Betty: You're really sensitive, aren't you?

Paul: I guess so. Maybe that's why I can't find a girlfriend.

## 一个浪漫的故事

```
保罗:贝蒂，你和约翰还在约会吗?

贝蒂:是啊，一切都很顺利。

保罗:你在哪里认识他的?

贝蒂:几周前我在图书馆遇到他。我们坐在同一张桌子旁，他向我借钢笔。

保罗:哇，这是个不错的故事。

贝蒂:前几天我跟吉姆说过这件事。他觉得这很浪漫。

保罗:你们俩今晚有安排吗?

贝蒂:是的，我想我们要去租一部电影。你最近有看过什么好东西（电影）吗?

保罗:前几天我看了《蜘蛛侠》。

贝蒂:我听说那是一部非常有趣的电影。

保罗:你开玩笑吧?那部电影一点都不好笑。这是悲伤的。最后我哭了。

贝蒂:你真的很敏感，不是吗?

保罗:我想是的。也许这就是我找不到女朋友的原因。
