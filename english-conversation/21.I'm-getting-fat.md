## I'm getting fat

```
Dan: Wow, I'm really getting fat.

Melissa: You don't look fat.

Dan: Yes, but I am. I've gained 10 pounds in the last two months. Look at my stomach.

Melissa: How much do you weigh?

Dan: I think about 170 pounds.

Melissa: What kind of foods do you eat?

Dan: I usually have pasta for dinner. Sometimes I get take-out or fast food if I don't have enough time to cook.

Melissa: I was reading a diet book the other day. It said that if you eat meat and nothing else, you'll lose weight quickly.

Dan: Wow, does that work?

Melissa: I don't know, but someone told me they tried it and lost 20 pounds.

Dan: That sounds good, but I'm not sure how long I could do that.

Melissa: I know, once you start eating vegetables and bread again you'll probably start gaining weight.

Dan: Well, I think I'm going to try it anyway. Who's the author?

Melissa: I can't remember. It's not that popular anymore. When I get home I'll check and give you a call.

## 我正在变胖

```
丹:哇，我真的长胖了。

梅丽莎:你看起来不胖。

丹:是的，但事实如此。过去两个月我体重增加了10磅。看我的肚子。

梅丽莎:你多重?

丹:我想大概170磅吧。

梅丽莎:你都吃什么食物?

丹:我晚餐通常吃意大利面。如果我没有足够的时间做饭，有时我会叫外卖或快餐。

梅丽莎:前几天我在看一本关于节食的书。它说，如果你只吃肉，你会很快减肥。

丹:哇，这管用吗?

梅丽莎:我不知道，但有人告诉我他们试过了，减了20磅。

丹:听起来不错，但我不确定我能坚持多久。

梅丽莎:我知道，一旦你开始吃蔬菜和面包，你可能会开始增重。

丹:好吧，我想我还是要试试。作者是谁?

梅丽莎:我不记得了。它不再那么流行了。我回家后会查一下，然后给你打电话。
