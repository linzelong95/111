## Nervous about surgery

```
Karen: Hi, Jim.

Jim: Hi, Karen. You look upset. What's wrong?

Karen: It's nothing. I'm just a little nervous.

Jim: Is everything all right?

Karen: Well, I'm having surgery tomorrow on my finger.

Jim: What's wrong with your finger?

Karen: I broke it the other day playing basketball.

Jim: Oh, that's terrible.

Karen: Yeah, it's been bothering me since that day.

Jim: Are you afraid of having surgery?

Karen: Yes. I've never had surgery before.

Jim: I wouldn't worry. I had to have surgery on my leg last year. Everything went fine.

Karen: Were you nervous before the surgery?

Jim: a little. Who's your doctor?

Karen: Dr. Allen.

Jim: Oh, I've heard he's really good. I don't think you have anything to worry about.

Karen: Good. That makes me feel much better.

## 担忧手术

```
凯伦:嗨,吉姆。

吉姆:嗨,凯伦。你看起来有点不安。怎么了?

凯伦:没什么。我只是有点紧张。

吉姆:一切都好吗?

凯伦:嗯，我的手指明天要做手术。

吉姆:你的手指怎么了?

凯伦:我前几天打篮球时把它弄坏了。

吉姆:哦，那太可怕了。

凯伦:是的，从那天起它就一直困扰着我。

吉姆:你害怕做手术吗?

凯伦:是的。我从来没有做过手术。

吉姆:我不担心。去年我的腿做了手术。所有事情都很顺利。

凯伦:手术前你紧张吗?

吉姆:一点点。你的医生是谁?

凯伦:艾伦博士。

吉姆:哦，我听说他很厉害。我觉得你没什么好担心的。

凯伦:好。这让我感觉好多了。
