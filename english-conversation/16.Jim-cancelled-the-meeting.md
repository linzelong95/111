## Jim cancelled the meeting

```
Jessica: Hey, I just talked to Jim.

Mark: What did he say?

Jessica: He said he had to cancel the meeting this afternoon.

Mark: Oh, I see.

Jessica: Is there a problem?

Mark: No, it's not a big deal. He and I were supposed to talk to some new customers today.

Jessica: Sorry to hear that.

Mark: It's ok. This has been happening quite a bit recently.

Jessica: That's strange. I wonder why?

Mark: His wife has been sick, so sometimes he has to go home early to take care of her.

Jessica: I see. How's work been going?

Mark: Things are slow right now. Would you mind if I borrow your phone, mine's out of batteries and I have to call my boss to tell him about this.

Jessica: OK, let me go get it. It's in the car.

## 吉姆取消会议

```
杰西卡:嘿，我刚和吉姆谈过。

马克:他说了什么?

杰西卡:他说他不得不取消今天下午的会议。

马克:哦，我明白了。

杰西卡:有什么问题吗?

马克:不，没什么大不了的。我和他今天本来要跟新客户谈的。

杰西卡:很遗憾听到这个消息。

马克:没关系。这种情况最近经常发生。

杰西卡:这很奇怪。我想知道为什么?

马克:他妻子病了，所以有时候他得早点回家照顾她。

杰西卡:我明白了。最近工作怎么样?

马克:现在进展缓慢。你介意我借用一下你的手机吗? 我的手机没电了，我得给老板打电话告诉他这件事。

杰西卡:好的，我去拿。它在车里。
